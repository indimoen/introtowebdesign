      <h1>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h1>
      <p class="intro">In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.<p>
      <h2>Written by John D. Berry</h2>
      <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.<p>
      <h3>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h3>
      <p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast.</p>
      <p>He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, it's important to make the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast of Size</li>
        <li>Contrast of Weight</li>
        <li>Contrast of Form</li>
        <li>Contrast of Structure</li>
        <li>Contrast of Texture</li>
        <li>Contrast of Color</li>
        <li>Contrast of Direction</li>
        <li>Other Types of Contrast</li>
