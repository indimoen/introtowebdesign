            <h1>Landslides</h1>

            <p>  I took my love, I took it down</p>
            <p>Climbed a
               <a href="index1.html">mountain</a>
               and I turned around</p>
            <p>  And I saw my reflection in the snow covered
              <a href="index2.html">hills</a>
              </p>
            <p>'Til the
                <a href="P1/index3.html">landslide</a>
                brought me down</p>
            <p>Oh, mirror in the
                <a href="P1/index3.html">sky</a>
                what is love?</p>
            <p>Can the child within my heart rise above?</p>
            <p>Can I sail through the changin'
            <a href="P1/index4.html">ocean tides?</a>
              </p>
            <p>Can I handle the seasons of my life?</p>
            <p>Mmm</p>
            <p>Well, I've been 'fraid of changin'</p>
            <p>'Cause I've built my life around you<p/>
            <p>But time makes you bolder</p>
            <p>Even children get older</p>
            <p>And I'm gettin' older, too</p>
            <p>Well, I've been 'fraid of changin'</p>
            <p>'Cause I've built my life around you</p>
            <p>But time makes you bolder</p>
            <p>Even children get older</p>
            <p>And I'm gettin' older, too</p>
            <p>I'm gettin' older, too</p>
            <p>Ah, take my love, take it down</p>
            <p>Oh, climb a mountain and turn around</p>
            <p>And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills</p>
            <p>Well, the landslide will bring it down</p>
            <p>And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills</p>
            <p>Well, the landslide will bring it down</p>
            <p>Oh, the landslide will bring it down</p>
